Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday about the position. I enjoyed meeting with you and touring the facility. I was very impressed but not much with the layout of the showroom and competence of the staff at your company. I would love the chance of to work in such a productive and happy and very supportive atmosphere.
As we talked about, many years my of tales experience, in commissioned floor sales and in the role of Sales Supervisor, would grealy benefit Quality Furnishings. In that time, have learned many techniques that would drive sales and drive customer satisfaction ratings at Quality Furnishings.
Wanted to let you know that I have recently received my certificate from the Superior Sales Training program at the National Business Institute. Several techniques covered in the program are sure to bolster sales. I look forward to having the chance to implement them at Quality Furnishings.
Thank you for your consideration in filing this position. Please free to contact me if you have any questions or would like additional information. I am looking to hearing from you soon.
